DOM (Document Object Model):


The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. 


When you open a web page in your browser, the browser retrieves the page’s HTML text and parses it. 
The browser builds up a model of the document’s structure and uses this model to draw the page on the screen. It provides an object-oriented representation of the web page, enabling you to modify its content and visual presentation by using a scripting language such as JavaScript. It represents the document with a logical tree containing nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. It acts as a live data structure: when it’s modified, the page on the screen is updated to reflect the changes.
