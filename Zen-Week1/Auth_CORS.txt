What is an auth?
An auth code (short for authorization code) is a unique string of random letters and numbers assigned to a domain. When you transfer a domain to another registrar, its auth code is required to start the transfer. Auth codes are also sometimes referred to as EPP codes or authinfo codes.




Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.


This cross-origin sharing standard can enable cross-site HTTP requests for:
* Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs, as discussed above.
* Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.
* WebGL textures.
* Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().
* CSS Shapes from images.
